# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Thera-Bank-s-Personal-Loan-Campaign
Thera Bank Personal Loan Campaign Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data from Thera Bank to understand factors that influence customers to accept personal loan offers. The objective is to use data-driven insights to improve future marketing campaigns, target the right customer segments, and increase the conversion rate for personal loans with minimal marketing costs.

Dataset Description
The dataset, Bank.xls, contains data on 5000 customers. It includes the following information:

Demographic Information: Age, income, family, education level, etc.
Customer Relationship with the Bank: Whether they have a mortgage, credit card, securities account, etc.
Personal Loan Campaign Response: Whether or not the customer accepted the personal loan during the previous campaign (Personal Loan).
Key Insights from the Data
The bank has a total of 5000 customers, of which 480 customers accepted the personal loan in the last campaign, representing 9.6% of the customer base.
The dataset provides an opportunity to analyze the profile of customers who are more likely to accept personal loan offers and those who aren’t, which can help optimize future marketing strategies.
Business Problem
Thera Bank’s management is interested in converting more of its liability customers (those holding deposits) to personal loan customers, while retaining them as depositors. The bank ran a successful marketing campaign last year, achieving a conversion rate of 9.6%, and now aims to devise better-targeted campaigns to increase this rate even further with limited marketing budget.

Objectives
Analyze Customer Data: Investigate the demographic and financial attributes of customers who accepted the personal loan offer and compare them with those who didn’t.
Identify Key Factors: Discover key factors that influence the likelihood of a customer accepting the loan, such as income level, family size, education, and banking habits.
Improve Targeting: Use the insights from data analysis to help the retail marketing team design better campaigns targeting customers with higher loan acceptance potential.
Tools and Techniques Used
Python (Optional): For advanced statistical analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
Key Features of the Analysis
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing or inconsistent data, prepared the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed descriptive analysis and visualizations to identify key patterns and trends in customer data.
Customer Segmentation: Grouped customers into different segments based on their likelihood of accepting personal loan offers.
Predictive Analysis (Optional): Developed models to predict future loan acceptance probability (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
Results
Key Trends Identified: Customers with higher income, longer relationships with the bank, and those with securities accounts were more likely to accept the loan offer.
Targeted Marketing Recommendations: The analysis provided actionable insights on which customer segments to focus on in future campaigns for better conversion rates.
